# pi-desktop

[中文文档](README.zh-CN.md)

A desktop workbench for running and managing multiple [pi](https://pi.dev) coding-agent sessions across project folders.

`pi-desktop` is not a fork of pi and does not reimplement the agent. It is a lightweight Electron shell that orchestrates multiple `pi --mode rpc` processes and provides a desktop UI for projects, sessions, files, history, model state, and conversation navigation.

## Architecture

```txt
pi-desktop
├─ Electron main process
│  ├─ manages project records
│  ├─ spawns pi --mode rpc processes
│  ├─ bridges file/session/git operations
│  └─ exposes safe IPC APIs
│
├─ Electron preload
│  └─ exposes window.piDesktop to the renderer
│
├─ React renderer
│  ├─ project and agent list
│  ├─ chat timeline
│  ├─ file/history drawers
│  ├─ model/context status
│  └─ settings UI
│
└─ pi runtime
   ├─ one pi RPC process per opened agent
   ├─ project cwd isolation
   └─ native pi sessions/tools/models/context
```

A key design rule is:

```txt
One Agent Tab = One pi RPC Process
```

This keeps sessions isolated, makes crashes local to one agent, and lets pi keep ownership of its native behavior.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+ recommended.
- npm.
- A working `pi` command in your system `PATH`.
- pi authentication configured separately, for example through `pi` / `/login` or API keys.

Check pi is available:

```bash
pi --version
pi --mode rpc
```

## Download

Prebuilt packages are published from tagged releases:

```txt
https://github.com/ayuayue/pi-desktop/releases
```

Available release assets are built by GitHub Actions for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

> Note: pi-desktop requires the `pi` command to be installed separately and available in your system `PATH`.

## Getting Started from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayuayue/pi-desktop.git
cd pi-desktop
npm install
npm run make-icon
npm run dev
```

The app expects `pi` to be available in `PATH` because it starts agents using:

```bash
pi --mode rpc
```

## Development

### Start dev mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Type-check

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

### Build renderer/main bundles

```bash
npm run build
```

### Package locally

```bash
npm run dist
```

Platform-specific package commands:

```bash
npm run dist:win
npm run dist:mac
npm run dist:linux
```

### Generate icon asset

```bash
npm run make-icon
```

This writes:

```txt
build/icon.svg
```

## Browser Preview Mode

You can open the Vite renderer URL directly in a browser for layout checks:

```txt
http://localhost:5173/
```

When opened outside Electron, `window.piDesktop` is not available. The renderer falls back to a mock preview API so the UI does not crash.

Browser preview is useful for:

- layout checks
- responsive design checks
- chat rendering checks
- markdown rendering checks

Browser preview does **not** validate real Electron IPC behavior such as:

- starting pi agents
- reading local sessions
- opening files
- exporting HTML

Use the Electron app for those flows.

```

## Important Implementation Notes

### Session ownership

`pi-desktop` reads pi session files for listing and summaries, but it does not directly mutate pi session JSONL files. Restoring and exporting sessions is done through pi RPC.

### Process isolation

Each opened agent owns a separate `pi --mode rpc` child process. This provides clean cwd isolation and avoids shared runtime state between agents.

### File operations

File operations use Electron `shell` APIs where possible:

- `shell.openPath`
- `shell.showItemInFolder`

This keeps behavior cross-platform and delegates file opening to the operating system.

### Model and thinking controls

The model and thinking controls call pi RPC commands:

- `get_state`
- `get_session_stats`
- `get_available_models`
- `set_model`
- `cycle_model`
- `set_thinking_level`
- `cycle_thinking_level`

## Current Limitations

- Packaging is not configured yet. The current repository builds Electron/Vite output but does not produce installers.
- The icon is currently generated as SVG only. Windows/macOS release packaging will need `.ico` / `.icns` generation.
- Browser preview mode uses mock data and does not test Electron IPC.
- File context menu is implemented in the renderer. More native menu behavior can be added later.
- Session parsing is best-effort and designed to tolerate pi session format evolution.

## Roadmap

- Add installer packaging with `electron-builder` or Forge.
- Add CI for type-check and build.
- Add screenshots and demo GIFs.
- Add native app icons for Windows/macOS/Linux.
- Add model search and provider grouping.
- Add richer tool-call rendering.
- Add file multi-select and attachment tray.
- Add session export open/reveal actions.
- Add automated Electron UI tests.

## Security

This app starts local `pi` processes and exposes file operations through Electron IPC. Only run the app from trusted source code.

It does not send telemetry or upload files by itself. Any model/provider network behavior is handled by pi and your configured providers.
